    <h3>Step 1: Rigid Bodies</h3>
        <h4>What are Rigid Bodies?</h4>
        <p>
            In this project topic, we produce a physics-based animation. Specifically, we simulate rigid
            body motion in 3D.<br><br>
            In terms of affine transformations we learned in the course of our test, it is easy to describe what happens for a rigid body. As a standard description, there is a model coordinate where the vertex
            position (and other attributes) of the geometric object are defined. Then,
            there is a model matrix T ∈ R<sup>4x4</sup>, that sends the positions in the model
            coordinate to the positions in the world coordinate:

    <h3>Step 2: Rotation of Rigid Bodies</h3>
        <h4>What are Rotational Bodies?</h4>
        <p>
            For a rigid body motion, it is T that changes over time,
            constituting an animation of object moving in the world. The vertex
            positions defined under the model coordinate remain static;
            they are stored in some vertex buers initially and never require
            any update. Moreover, for arigid body, the time-dependent model
            matrix always takes the form of “first a rotation about the center
            of mass, followed by a translation”:

    <h3>Step 3: Rotational Bodies Inertia</h3>
        <h4>What is Rotational Bodies Inertia?</h4>
        <p>
            A fundamental assumption of rigid body motion is that the moment of
            inertia depends only on the shape of the geometry, which is
            completely static when we are in the model coordinate, which means
            it is time-independent. But is defined as M<sub>world</sub> = RM<sub>model</sub>R<sup>-1</sup> in
            the world coordinate.
            <br>
            A common practice is to set the model coordinate to align with the eigenvectors of
            Mmodel so that we can simply assume the M<sub>model</sub> would be:

            The angular momentum of the system is given by the following vector in the world coordinate:
        </p>
        <img id="equation" src="images/momentum.png" alt="momentum">

        <h4>Angular Velocity</h4>
            <p>
                What describes the rotation motion is the change in R(t) over
                time. Such a change is described by a vector ω ∈ R world (in
                the world coordinate) called the angular velocity. The length
                of this vector |ω| is the rotation speed, and the direction
                ω/|ω| is the rotation axis. Put it simply, when an object
                has an angular velocity ω, after a short amount of time ∆t, the new
                orientation R(t+∆t) will be further rotated by the angular
                velocity.

        <h4>Conservation law</h4>
        <p>
            In a rigid body motion, we have conservation of energy and
            conservation of angular momentum. More precisely,
            <li>E<sub>kinetic</sub> remains constant. (Conservation of energy)</li> 
            <li>L remains constant (in the world coordinate). (Conservation of
            angular momentum)</li>
            <li>Mmodel ramins constant. (Rigidity)</li>
            These conservation laws alone allow us to develop the animation.
        </p>

        <h4>Core Algorithms</h4>
        <p>
            A simple algorithm directly based on conservation of angular
            momentum, we used an improvement method that was introduced in UCSD by Sam Buss in 2001. After running the animation for a longer time this method works well for small ∆t.

    <h3>Step 4: Poinsot's ellipsoids</h3>
        <h4>What is Poinsot's ellipsoids?</h4>
        <p>
            The two conservation laws (energy and angular momentum) can be visualized by Poinsot's ellipsoids. The conservation of energy says that

            As for conservation of angular momentum, we have L being constant in the world coordinate. In the model coordinate, Λ(t) is not constant. But the |Λ(t)| = |L| will be constant.Recall Λ(t) = MmodelΩ(t). So,
        </p>

        <p>
            To visually verify that our algorithm is doing the correct thing,
            we render the position Ω and see if it lies on the intersection of
            both ellipsoids in the model coordinate.We can also transform both
            ellipsoid in the world and see if ω lies on the intersection of the
            transformed ellipsoids.The intersection of the two ellipsoids is
            called the polhode.

    <h3>Step 5: Putting it all together</h3>
        <p>
            The vector ω ∈ R world describes how fast the orientation is modified
            over time. ω is analogous to velocity. Sometimes we will also look at ω
            in the model coordinate, which is given by a straightforward
            transformation "omega".
        </p>
        <img id="equation" src="images/omega.png" alt="omega">
        <p>
            To visually verify that our algorithm is doing the correct thing,
            we render the position Ω (shown by the black moving dot), in order
            to see if it
            lies on the intersection of both ellipsoids in the model
            coordinate.We can also transform both ellipsoid in the world and
            see if ω lies on the intersection of the transformed ellipsoids.The intersection of the two ellipsoids is
            called the polhode.
